## About Me
I’m a CS major at UNCG. I like building clean, usable software and I’m taking this course to level up my real-world process (planning, version control, teamwork). Outside class I’m active on campus and into creative projects & events.

## My CSC340 Goals
- Get comfortable with Git + GitHub flow for teamwork  
- Practice writing clear specs/design docs (not just code)  
- Ship a working project with a clean API and a simple UI
