## 1 Product Overview
**GlamConnect** is a web app that connects **customers** with local beauty **providers** (stylists, nail techs, lash techs, MUAs).  
Providers publish services (name, category, duration, price, availability), and customers search, book, and review services.  
The goal is a simple, reliable marketplace experience with clear scheduling and communication.
